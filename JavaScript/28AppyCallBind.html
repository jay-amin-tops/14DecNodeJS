    <h3>Javascript: call(), apply() and bind()</h3>
    <h5>“this” refresher</h5>
    <p> In Object Oriented JS we learned that in JS, everything is an object. Because everything is an object, we came
        to understand that we could set and access additional properties to functions.
    </p>
    <p> Setting properties to a function and additional methods via the prototype is super awesome … but how do we
        access them?!??!</p>
    <p>Up until now we have treated functions as objects that are composed of a name (optional, can also be an anonymous
        function) and the code it executes when it is invoked. But that isn’t the entire truth. As a truth loving
        person, I must let you know that a function actually looks closer to the following image:</p>
    <script>
        // var pokemon = {
        //     firstname: 'Pika',
        //     lastname: 'Chu ',
        //     getPokeName: function () {
        //         var fullname = this.firstname + ' ' + this.lastname;
        //         return fullname;
        //     }
        // };
        // // var pokemonName =  ()=> { //Uncaught TypeError: this.getPokeName is not a function
        // var pokemonName = function () {
        //     console.log(this.getPokeName() + 'I choose you!');
        // };

        // var logPokemon = pokemonName.bind(pokemon); // creates new object and binds pokemon. 'this' of pokemon === pokemon now

        // logPokemon(); // 'Pika Chu I choose you!'
        var pokemon = {
            firstname: 'Pika',
            lastname: 'Chu ',
            getPokeName: function () {
                var fullname = this.firstname + ' ' + this.lastname;
                return fullname;
            }
        };
        var pokemonName = function (snack, hobby) {
            console.log(this.getPokeName() + ' loves ' + snack + ' and ' + hobby);
        };
        pokemonName.call(pokemon, 'sushi', 'algorithms'); // Pika Chu  loves sushi and algorithms
        pokemonName.apply(pokemon, ['sushi', 'algorithms']); // Pika Chu  loves sushi and algorithms
    </script>
</body>
